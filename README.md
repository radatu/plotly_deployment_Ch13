# Data Analytics README
## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset using Plotly to create interactive visualizations and a dashboard. The dataset is stored in samples_clean_data.json.

## Files Included
samples_clean_data.json: the cleaned dataset used for the analysis
charts.js: JavaScript code used to create the charts and customize the dashboard

## How to Use
To run the dashboard and view the visualizations, open the index.html file in a web browser. The dashboard allows users to select a volunteer ID and view the demographic information, as well as the visualizations for that particular volunteer.

## Conclusion
The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset provides valuable insights into the microbial species found in human belly buttons. By visualizing this data using Plotly, we can identify the top bacterial species and their frequency in the samples. This information can be used to identify potential candidates for manufacturing synthetic beef, and also highlights the importance of hygiene practices such as belly button washing.
